This repository contains files for [A3 Wounding System (AIS)](https://forums.bohemia.net/forums/topic/161291-a3-wounding-system-ais-by-psycho/) with some modifictations/bug fixes (see git history).


## Notable changes

- Added compatiblity for CDLC/custom healing items


### Warning

Code of this OLD revive system is quite bad, it uses `removeAllEventHandlers` and `removeAllActions` which can break your scripts and compatiblity with any mod.

Use at your own risk.
